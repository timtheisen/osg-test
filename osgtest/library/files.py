"""
Functions for dealing with writing and tracking of files.

The most important part of this module is the backup mechanism.
Backups are identified by a (filepath, owner) pair--where owner is an
arbitraty string identifying the test component responsible for the file,
specifically its cleanup.

preserve() does the backup. It raises an error if a pair has been used.
Normally you would not call it directly, but call write(), append() or
replace(), and pass either the value of owner, or backup=False.
restore() puts the backup back to its original location.

Since one owner cannot back up the same file twice, if you modify a file
twice in one module then you must either call preserve() directly, or pass
an owner for the first append/replace/write call, and backup=False for all
subsequent calls to append/replace/write.

(You could also use a different owner for each change, but then you would
have to restore it for each owner you used else the cleanup test will fail).
